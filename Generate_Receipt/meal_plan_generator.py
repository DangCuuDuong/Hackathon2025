You are a professional nutrition assistant. Please create a **3-day meal plan** for one person based on the information below:

üì¶ **Available ingredients in the fridge:**  
{json.dumps(ingredients, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)}

‚ù§Ô∏è **Personal preferences:**  
- Preferred spice level: {preferences.get("spice_level", "medium")}
- Diet type: {preferences.get("diet_type", "eat clean")}
- Allergies / dislikes: {', '.join(preferences.get("allergies_or_dislikes", []))}
- Favorite foods: {', '.join(preferences.get("favorite_foods", []))}

üí™ **Health condition:**

- Goals: {health.get("health_goals", "muscle gain")}
- Nutrition targets: {json.dumps(health.get("nutrition_targets", {}), ensure_ascii=False)}

üß† **Meal planning rules:**
- Create a plan for 5 full days.
- Each day MUST include 2 to 3 meals: **breakfast, lunch, and dinner**.
- üî• Each meal MUST contain **2 to 3 different dishes (recipes)**. Do NOT generate only 1 dish per meal.
- You MAY reuse dishes within the same day to save cooking effort.
- Prioritize using the available ingredients as much as possible.
- Avoid allergens and respect food dislikes.
- Ensure nutritional targets are reasonably met.
- Keep each recipe enough detailed and add numbers to each steps, healthy, and suitable for daily home cooking.

‚úçÔ∏è **Output JSON format:**
[
  {{
    "day": "Day 1",
    "meals": [
      {{
        "meal_name": "Breakfast",
        "recipes": [

          ...
        ]
      }},
      ...
    ]
  }},
  ...

Please strictly follow the rules above. Make sure **each meal includes at least 2 recipes**.
